Each data file corresponds to a set of conformers.
Each entry is a conformer has the following key value pairs:
    positions:  Atomic positions given in Angstrom
    elements:  atomic symbols
    smiles:  SMILES string representation of molecule
    charge:  net charge of molecule
    energies:  a dictionary of key value pairs of computed energies in Hartree
               The energy keys are QeqNN, QeqNN-TB, QRNN, QRNN-TB, SANI, GFN2-xTB, PM7 and wB97X-D/6-31G*
